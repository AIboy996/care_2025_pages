Please submit your abstract in our CMT platform. Listed below are several important requirements for preparing and submitting a manuscript to CARE 2025. Failure to abide by the following requirements when preparing your manuscripts may result in desk rejection of the manuscript:
- **Manuscript template**: Papers must be submitted electronically in searchable pdf format following the guidelines for authors and LaTeX and MS Word templates available at [Lecture Notes in Computer Science](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). Manuscripts should be up to 8-pages (text, figures and tables) plus up to 2 pages of references. To provide flexibility, the submission may be extended up to a maximum of **12 pages**, including both content and references. No modifications to the templates are permitted. 
- **Anonymization**: The CARE 2025 review process is **double-blind**, i.e. the names of the authors and reviewers are not revealed to each other. Papers must thus be properly anonymized before submission and breach of anonymization will lead to automatic desk rejection.
- **Data use declaration and acknowledgment**: Authors must declare the data origin for each track of CARE 2025, or any other public or private data used in the preparation of the paper. The paper must include the co-authors, paper citations, and/or acknowledgments as required by CARE 2025 or any public or private data used in the preparation of the paper. The data use declaration does not have to be a dedicated section in the paper, and the required information can be provided anywhere in the main text (for example, as part of the description of the experimental setup).
