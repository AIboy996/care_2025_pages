<!-- ## Introduction

Since the test set will not be released, we require Docker submissions from all the participants for the evaluation. In the next section, we will explain how to build a docker from scratch. We also provide a simple example of how to containerize python codes for the CARE challenge datasets. The source code can be found on GitHub: [Fudan-ZMIC-Lab/CARE_challenge](github_link).

Please upload the zipped docker container to cloud platforms such as Mega, Google Drive and Baidu, send the download link and the command to execute your container to us care@googlegroups.com.

For any questions, please contact us feta-challenge@googlegroups.com.

Please remember to fill in the following form with your submission: FeTA Challenge Algorithm Description Submission -->
